Name: Anthony Matter
Student ID#: 2350704
Code Files Submitted: Sorting.h, Sorting.cpp, mainprogram.cpp

References for Assignment8: The only reference that I used for Assignment 8 was the Zybooks so that I could fully understand all three sorting algorithms that I 
was going to implement into my program.

Issues for Assignment8: Outside of a few initial compiler errors that were easy to solve, there weren't any big issues that I ran into on this assignment because 
I felt that I had a good understanding of the three algorithms I implemented.
