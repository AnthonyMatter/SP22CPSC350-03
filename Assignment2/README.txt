Name: Anthony Matter
Student ID#: 2350704
Code Files Submitted: Parser.cpp, Parser.h, and mainprogram.cpp
References for Assignment2: I utilized the website Geeks for Geeks to make sure that I was using the right syntax to call the functions and get the index position.
Issues for Assignment2: The main issue that I encountered towards the end of the process was simply compiling the files because one of the files wasn't getting called. After going to office hours I figured that I simply wasn't compiling the Parser.cpp file, only the mainprogram.cpp file.
