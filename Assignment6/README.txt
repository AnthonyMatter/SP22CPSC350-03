References for Assignment6: The biggest reference that I used for this assignment was GeeksForGeeks and my collaborator to figure out how to create a list of objects.

Issues for Assignment6: The main issue that we had for this assignment was finding to track how multiple values were progressing within one single element. For the longest time I wasn't sure what to do until my collaborator had found that you can create an entire list of objects. This evidently made it much easier to keep track of the waiting time, window time as well as the idle time within one element.
