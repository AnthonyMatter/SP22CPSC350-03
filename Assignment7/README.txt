References for Assignment7: The biggest references that I used for this assignment were StackOverFlow and GeeksForGeeks particulary for figuring out the syntax when storing and manipulating trees for certain situations.

Issues for Assignment7: The biggest issue that we had on this assignment was to properly implement the rollback into the program. We tried to copy and save previous trees but ultimately we decided to utilize doubly linked lists
to store objects that we could later use when the user wants to reverse their previous decision. The other issue that we came across early on was how to print the student and faculty IDs in ascending order. We eventually were able
to figure out the issue by reconfiguring our InOrder implementation on the BST header file.
