Name: Anthony Matter
Student ID#: 2350704
Code Files Submitted: Model.cpp, Model.h, Translator.cpp, Translator.h, FileProcessor.cpp, FileProcessor.h and mainprogram.cpp
References for Assignment3: I utilized the website Geeks for Geeks to make sure that I had the right syntax when checking if characters were alphabetical and if they were lowercase and uppercase. Also, I referred to the File I/O slides on canvas to make sure that I was reading from the input file and writing into the output file correctly.

Issues for Assignment3: One issue was when I compiled my code, I was encountering a segmentation fault which basically means that something in my code caused my program to abort. After going to office hours I was able to find that I accidently was printing a string character in my switch statement in Model.cpp instead of returning. After making that correction, my code was performing correctly.
