Name: Anthony Matter
Student ID#: 2350704
Code Files Submitted: Stack.h, AStack.h, FileAnalyzer.cpp, FileAnalyzer.h, mainprogram.cpp

References for Assignment5: The biggest reference that I used for this assignment was GeeksForGeeks when I wanted to fully understand the concepts behind stacks.

Issues for Assignment5: The main issue that I had with the assignment throughout the week was making sure that only the open delimeters were getting pushed into the stack and would only get popped from the stack if their closing delimeter
was about to be pushed in to the stack. Luckily, after a lot of thinking and trial and error, I was able to fix the problem.
